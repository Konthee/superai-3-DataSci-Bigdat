## Introduction

  The Super AI Engineer 2022: Data Science and Big Data Challenge is a competition for participants to develop strategies for predicting car ownership from a questionnaire dataset. In this notebook, I used AutoGluon, an open-source library developed by Amazon Web Services, to optimize hyperparameters and ensemble methods for our machine learning model. AutoGluon simplifies the process of building and deploying machine learning models by providing a high-level interface for training deep learning models using various frameworks and tools for automating hyperparameter optimization and ensemble learning. The competition dataset is not publicly available, so participants must provide their own dataset. This notebook is intended to be a resource and inspiration for other participants in the competition.
